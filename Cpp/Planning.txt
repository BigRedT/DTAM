What the DTAM does:
DTAM has many tasks and sorts them to decide which to do next:


Level 1
1. Keep the ESM chain aligned
2. Make sure there is a valid depth map to align against

Level 2
1. Improve the quality of the current depth map(doesn't seem to help tracking!)



















1. Keep frames aligned in 2D
    1. Align newest frames first when possible 
2. Feed hungry maps
    1. Feed newest maps first
    




A frame marked for map consumption but unalignable causes a failure.
